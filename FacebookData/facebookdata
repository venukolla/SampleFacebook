Horrible, Horrible, Horrible, Horrible, Horrible, Horrible, Horrible, Horrible, Horrible CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! I have been with Sprint for 14+ years, and the following was the worse customer service I have ever experienced!! In February 2016, purchase an IPhone 6S, a Mophie case, and the screen protector from the Sprint store. In March the Mophie cased overheated, it got so hot the charger infused to the case, and the screen protector, which was supposed to be indestructible, had cracked. I brought the Mophie case and screen protector to another store and they replaced them with no problem. Shortly after these replacements, the phone shutdown and felt extremely hot, once cooled, I was able to restore power and it was ok for several days, then approximately a week later the same then happened again (without the Mophie case on), once cooled down and it turned back on. A few weeks later, it happened again! On June 13, 2016, approximately at 2:27 pm, I brought my phone to the San Leandro, CA Sprint store because it had overheated again and shut off! When I got there, I was greeted by Christina (a Lead Sales Person), I explained to her the issues I had been having, and the phone had overheated again and shutdown, she felt the phone and said, ‚ÄúIt is usually hot‚Äù; she passed me on to another Lead Sales Person to assist. He was able to turn the phone on, and explained to me why the phone was overheating was is because, ‚Äúyou had too many apps open (4), emails (96), and voicemails (13)‚Äù. A phone should not overheat with these things running! I asked what he/Sprint could do for me, I am was not comfortable using this phone, not sure, if it would overheat again and/or exploded, or catch my house on fire while charging! He stated, ‚ÄúThere was nothing he/Sprint could do and I would have to file a claim and/or take the phone to an Apple Store, and if my house did catch on fire I should contact Apple‚Äù. I understand sometimes there is nothing the store can do, however, he never looked at my account, and the lack on concern is not what I EXPECTED from Sprint. So, I called customer service/technical support and spoke to Morgan, she was EXCELLENT, exceptional customer service, she told me the store should have offered me an Advance Exchange, which they did not, and when I called ask for a manager for assistance!! I called the San Leandro, CA store (6/13/2016 @ 5:54 pm) and asked for manager, ‚ÄúNappy‚Äù the host, stated, ‚ÄúHer Manager Nelson was on maternity bonding time leave and there was no manager on duty, they were still looking for his replacement, and to call back in a few weeks or so to speak to a manager‚Äù. And then the call was disconnected, when I called back at approximately 6:00 pm, I spoke to ‚ÄúTY‚Äù, he said the same, at this time they have no manger and there was no one available at this time to assist me with my issues/concerns‚Äù. I am seriously considering closing my account and going elsewhere!!

Whomever is overseeing this region should also take a look at the previous Yelp reviews, seems to be the same story of poor customer service!!!

However, in the last couple of years, the service has slowly declined and the service in my area is horrible. If I'm lucjy, I get 3G speeds at home and around town. It's hard to view videos or pictures or stream movies. The only way I can do it is when I connect to my wifi. I live in the 78390. I have lots of family members that are currently with AT&T and they have excellent reception no matter where they go. Also, my bill is through the roof. I'd like for it to be cut in half the way you all are offering new customers. I think I deserve it after being a loyal customer for all these years in spite of the bad seevice I'm getting. I've been offered to have my contract bought out and am seriously considering the offer.,null,null,8389383510_10153718685428511,null,Sprint has horrible customer service and the perfect people to deliver it I'll make it a full time job to make sure every single person knows it even I have to post here everyday 3 times a day üò°,null,null,8389383510_10153718639363511,null,I'm sorry but this is really urgent?  I am getting my new phones switching to Sprint but I told the sales rep the other day I can't do til July 1st and now I"m told I"m getting these phones tomorrow.  How long do I have before I activate new phones? My computer is in shop being fixed and I have no way of backing up this information.  Please your reps are giving me a run around,null,null,8389383510_10153718629138511,null,I can't believe it's been four days without my issue being resolved. I look online and your bait and switch tactics have not been fixed either. If I opt to pick-up a phone at the store - I won't be able to get it because when I go to the store, it'll be out of stock. When I asked customer service about it, they said the terms and conditions of SHIPPING are clear - the item is on back-order. I did not want the item shipped, I told the agent. Shipping has nothing to do with picking-up in store. No where on the site does it say that. I was told terms and conditions apply for in-store pick-up. Me, as the consumer, must connect the puzzle pieces when I order this phone over the internet to pick-up at a store. Please fix this issue. I need a phone today. I want a phone because your service can't seem to get internet connection to my phone. It had it before. Now it doesn't. I was told there is nothing I can do but buy another phone. I can't even do that.,null,null,8389383510_10153718623953511,null,I have a couple of your employees asleep under a tree in my yard in Raleigh nc.

I can only Guess that SPRINT CENSORED MY POST. NOT BECAUSE OF ANY BAD LAUGAUGE, BUT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT A GOOD REVIEW OF SPRINT AND THE IMPOSSIBLE EVER EFFORT THEY WERE MAKING FOR ME TO RETURN THEIR "FREE TABLET" WITHIN THEIR "30 DAY SATISFACTION GUARANTEE". THREE TRIPS, TWO STORES AND NO SATISFACTION! THIS POST HAS BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED FOR DOCUMENTATION PURPOSES.

I told the phone rep that I wouldn't be able to do anything til the first of the month and now I"m told I'll have the phones tomorrow.  Please advise?   Thank you.,null,null,8389383510_10153718564873511,null,I have been a Sprint Customer for over 10 YEARS and in the past 14 days, a Sprint Preferred Reseller store and a Sprint Corporate Store has given me nothing but excuse after excuse, as to why the other store has to take care of returning a "FREE" tablet. They never mentioned the small print of a $75.00 "Restocking FEE" to my wife when they talked her into accepting the "FREE" tablet. Both stores display the "30 DAY SATISFACTION GUARANTEE", there is no small print on the signs.

First attempt to return the tablet to the Sprint Preferred Reseller store was within 24hours of receiving it from said store. SPF store was extremely rude to my wife when she called about retuning the "FREE" Tablet.

As a retired US Marine, it boils down to Principls, Honesty and the Equatible Rule of Law. I have enough docuementation, videos and pictures of each multiple visits to these two stores to return the "FREE TABLET ! ", to make a very good court case for both civil and criminal charges against Sprint. If that is what it takes, Sprint will learn at least one thing, MY TIME IS VERY EXPENSIVE to teach Sprint the finer points of law, because of what I am doing.

Just because some one has a policy and or a contract does not make either legal unless the documents and excution of said docuements do not voilate any laws. My documentation shows that Sprint and its employees have chosen to act outside the law.

One note about me. I have won 19 out 19 court cases, because I am well trained by the Inelligence services of the United State's Government. (this statement can be vetted if you like),null,null,8389383510_10153718538528511,null,Over three hours on the phone. The plan I was sold in the store was not what I got.
